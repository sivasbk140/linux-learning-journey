# 🐧 Linux Learning Journey

This repo contains my personal notes while learning Linux — from basic navigation to powerful command-line tools.

## 📂 Files
- **basic-commands.md** – commands for navigating files, creating folders, and managing content
- **top-commands.md** – commonly used tools like `grep`, `chmod`, `tail`, `ps` and more

I created this to track my progress and share what I’ve learned with others on the same path.

Feel free to explore, fork, or suggest improvements! 🚀
